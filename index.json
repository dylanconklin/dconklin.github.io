Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific minimum number of hours that you are expected to work and you should check with about these in the first meeting. Graduate students are generally expected to work an average of at least 40 hours per week. For M.S., undergrad, and high school students this will vary depending on the project. You are not expected to work on weekends and holidays. Consult with Primal and notify fellow lab members in advance of any planned absences during the week. As a student, you should feel flexible to create a work schedule that work for you while meeting the expectations of your role.\nIf you prefer to work remotely, this should be discussed and approved by Primal and arranged in accordance with Portland State University Polices on Remote Work. All lab members are expected to attend certain in-person events.\nNote: All female researchers are entitled to two days of leave when they are on their periods.\nIndividual Meetings Following the first meeting, we will set up a time for regular individual meetings. Together, we’ll decide upon the timing and frequency of these meetings that will involve you, Primal, and any others working on the research project (e.g., PhD students, collaborators etc.). To make these meetings productive, please prepare an agenda in the form of document or slides.\nPast: Key points from our previous meeting. Present: Updates on what you have worked on since our last discussion. Future: Your plan for upcoming tasks or areas where you need feedback. Primal will help in problem solving, providing constructive feedback and general support during these meetings.\nAfter the meeting, please share meeting notes with Primal summarizing the main discussion points within a day of the meeting. This helps keep discussions fresh in everyone’s mind. Use this provided template to organize the meeting notes. Primal will review these meetings and may reach out with clarifying questions or additional guidance on the tasks.\nDo not cancel meetings with Primal if you feel that you have not made adequate progress on your research; these might be the most critical times to meet with a mentor.\nGroup Meetings The schedule and venue for meetings will be determined at the beginning of the quarter and announced in the mailing list. In the beginning of the meeting, Primal will make group announcements followed by a presentation from the students. All the DIPr lab students are expected to present at least once during the quarter. This presentation can be one of the following:\nResearch presentation: A detailed talk about your research project covering aspects such as motivation, approach, and evaluation. Project workshopping: A brief presentation of the problem that you are working on followed by collaborative brainstorming for the remainder of the meeting. Tutorial: A hands-on presentation on a tool or a new approach that could benefit the entire group. If you are the presenter, send a detailed draft of the presentation to Primal at least 3 days prior to the meeting. Primal will review the presentation and will give you feedback on the presentation outline and indidivual slides.\nWe will use a shared Google Sheet to organize the presentation. Active participation is encouraged, so please ask questions and engage in discussions.

Current Database Management Systems (DBMS) struggle to efficiently answer queries while enforcing a large number of Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC) policies. Sieve is a middleware for relational DBMSs that generate guarded expressions, which are efficient rewriting of queries with a given set of policies. In this paper, we extend Sieve with caching of guarded expressions to better handle dynamic workloads involving a series of policy insertions and queries at different frequencies. Our novel caching approach includes a replacement policy based on clock algorithm and a refresh strategy based on cost analysis to select between regeneration and update of guarded expressions. We also develop a workload generator that creates different workloads with different distributions of policies, and queries that are relevant to a chosen scenario. These workloads simulate realistic IoT scenarios, such as smart campus applications. Experimental results show that Sieve, enhanced with caching, is effective in terms of cache-hits and efficient in terms of system load and latency of query answering, in dynamic environments.\n","date":1718928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718928000,"objectID":"535490853041e2f2899485d01cec010a","permalink":"/post/06-21-24-anadi-rpe/","publishdate":"2024-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/06-21-24-anadi-rpe/","section":"post","summary":"Anadi Shakya completed her Research Proficiency Examination (RPE) about her work on improving {{% mention \"Sieve\" %}}.","tags":null,"title":"RPE presentation - Anadi Shakya","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Summer Research Academy (SRA) is designed to engage undergraduate students interested in making a difference in their communities by pursuing research opportunities in STEM, biomedical, behavioral, clinical, health, and social sciences.
