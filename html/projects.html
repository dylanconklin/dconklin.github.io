    <h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/dconklin/mess" target="_blank">MESSenger</a></h2>
    <p>
        MESSenger is an instant messaging server that you can connect to via telnet. It features an easy to use interface with a help option, utilizes a SQLite database to store messages locally, and provides public and private messaging options.

    <h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/dconklin/eldrow" target="_blank">Eldrow (Wordle)</a></h2>
    <p>
        I recently posted a program on my Gitlab called Eldrow, which is a command line Wordle clone. Included is a program that will generate a dictionary for the game, and a sample dictionary file to generate from.

    <p>
        I plan on adding more features to this game, such as a solver, arrow key support, and will make the current features more rebust.

    <h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/dconklin/deal-or-no-deal" target="_blank">Deal or No Deal</a></h2>
    <p>
        Deal or No Deal is a game show that I used to like watching when I was a kid, so I wrote a command line version of this game.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's not the most complex piece of code ever, but I thought I'd share this for anyone who is interested in playing.

    <h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/dconklin/adjacency-table" target="_blank">Adjacency Table</a></h2>
    <p>
        Adjacency Table is a program that imports data from a file, and generates an adjacency table based on the data. The data file contains a number to indicate any given point on a map, another point to indicate another point on a map, and a distance between the two points.
    </p>

    <p>
        I originally wrote this program for a Discrete Structures class, and reused the code later for an Algorithms class, and fixed it up with the help of two of my lab partners. We were pleasantly surprised with the resulting program.

    <h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/dconklin/number-converter" target="_blank">Number Converter</a></h2>
    <p>
        I recently posted a program on my Gitlab called "Number Converter". It allows you to put in a value and change the base of that number, and prints out the number in the new base.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's a little limited in scope, because it can't handle negative numbers, but is very scalable, and allows you to use whatever character set you want.
