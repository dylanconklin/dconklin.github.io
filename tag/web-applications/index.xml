      <description>&lt;p&gt;Users are increasingly adopting collaborative cloud services like Google Drive.
The lack of fine-grained access controls on many cloud services make actions that violate the expectations of other users likely, resulting in multiuser conflicts.
For example, a user with editor permissions may add a user outside the organization and revoke the permissions of another user, all without consent from the original resource owner.
These multiuser conflicts may compromise a resource&amp;rsquo;s confidentiality, integrity, or availability, leading to a lack of trust in cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCORD is a web application built on top of Google Drive which prevents and detects multiuser conflicts.
It employs a simulator to help users preemptively identify potential conflicts and
assist them in defining action constraints.
Then, using these action constraints, ACCORD can automatically detect future conflicts and suggest resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are testing the scalability and practicality of ACCORD with larger numbers of users and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
